# Python Programming Exercises

This repository features hands-on Python exercises aligned with my learning path. Each script is organized per topic and serves as part of my foundational practice in programming, in preparation for virtual assistant tasks and future web development projects.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- `01_hello_world.py` – Basic print function to display text output.
- `02_drawing_shape.py` – Drawing a simple triangle shape using print statements.
- `03_variables_and_data_types.py` – Introduction to variables and basic data types.
- `04_working_with_strings.py` – String functions like lower, upper, replace, and indexing.
- `05_working_with_numbers.py` – Arithmetic operations, order of operations, and math module.
- `06_basic_calculator.py` – This program performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- `07_mad_libs_game.py` – A simple game that asks the user for words and plugs them into a story. Great for practicing user input and string formatting.
- `08_sample_lists_functions.py` – Demonstrates how to use various list functions and methods to manipulate lists in Python.
  
## 🎯 Goal

To build a strong programming foundation using Python as I transition into tech-assisted virtual assistance and eventually web development in the future.
