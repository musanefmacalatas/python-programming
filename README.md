# Python Programming Exercises

This repository contains 30 Python exercises that document my learning journey in programming.  
Each script is organized by topic with clear descriptions, showcasing hands-on practice in Python fundamentals.  

These exercises not only strengthen my problem-solving and coding skills but also serve as part of my preparation for virtual assistant tasks (automation, data handling) and future projects in web development.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- `01_my_first_program.py` – Basic print function to display text output.
- `02_drawing_shape.py` – Drawing a simple triangle shape using print statements.
- `03_variables_and_data_types.py` – Introduction to variables and basic data types.
- `04_working_with_strings.py` – String functions like lower, upper, replace, and indexing.
- `05_working_with_numbers.py` – Arithmetic operations, order of operations, and math module.
- `06_basic_calculator.py` – This program performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- `07_mad_libs_game.py` – A simple game that asks the user for words and plugs them into a story. Great for practicing user input and string formatting.
- `08_sample_lists_functions.py` – Demonstrates how to use various list functions and methods to manipulate lists in Python.
- `09_tuples_exercise.py` – Demonstrates how to use tuples to store ordered, immutable collections in Python.
- `10_functions.py` – Demonstrates how to create a Python function using 'def', pass parameters, and call the function with different arguments to display custom output.
- `11_return_statement.py` – Demonstrates how to use the return statement in Python functions to send back results, assign returned values to variables, and perform operations with the returned data. Includes examples with math computations and user input.
- `12_if_else.py` – Demonstrates how to use if, elif, and else statements to handle multiple conditions and apply different actions based on user input.
- `13_if_else_comparison.py` – Demonstrates how to use if, elif, and else statements with comparison operators to find the maximum value among three numbers.
- `14_dictionary_lookup.py` – Demonstrates how to use dictionaries with `in` and `is not None` checks to validate key existence, handle missing values, and format output with f-strings.
- `15_while_loop.py` – Demonstrates how to use a while loop with conditionals and user input to simulate a simple store, update variable values, control program flow with break, and display messages using f-strings.
- `16_guessing_game.py` – This is a simple Python guessing game built using while loops and if-else statements. The program asks the player to guess a predefined word (SPIDERMAN). The player has a maximum of 3 attempts to guess correctly.
- `17_for_loops_.py ` – This Python script demonstrates different applications of for loops. This exercise is designed to practice how for loops work, including iterating over strings, lists, ranges, and real-world datasets.
- `18_exponent.py` – Demonstrates how to create functions to compute powers and sum of powers in Python, using loops and the exponent operator (**). Includes examples with clear comments for understanding the logic.
- `19_2d_list_nestedloops.py` – This program demonstrates how to work with **2D lists** (lists inside a list) and use **nested loops** to iterate over rows and columns.
- `20_translator.py` - This program demonstrates two string manipulation exercises using Python. "String Translator" Replaces all vowels (AEIOUaeiou) with the letter "g" or "G" depending on the case.Demonstrates conditional statements, loops, and string concatenation. "String Masking" Keeps the first and last character of a word visible while replacing the characters in between with asterisks (*). Demonstrates string slicing and the len() function.
  
## 🎯 Goal

To build a strong programming foundation using Python as I transition into tech-assisted virtual assistance and eventually web development in the future.
